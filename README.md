# ESP32-Desktop-Control
This project is for a device which allows me to switch between inputs to my monitors and usb devices. Control for this device is done on a nextion 3.2 in tft display. 

Also implemented is a weather API connection to get a daily forecast

Finally, a connection to my google calendar is implemented to get a list of things I need to do in the coming days
